Health checking service

Health checking service which performs network based health checks and HTTP API
responses. This is intended to be coupled with a CoreDNS plugin
(https://gitlab.redchimney.com/Allyn.Bottorff/coredns-gtm) which calls the API
to do dynamic lookups.

== Structure

* Axum API framework
* Tokio-based asynchronous health checking tasks
